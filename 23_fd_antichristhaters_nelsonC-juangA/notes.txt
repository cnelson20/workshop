K23 - using classmates' reference to learn a framework
2021-12-01

DISCO:
- Foundation's grid system seems to be the equivalent of containers in Boostrap
- Bootstrap seems to include more predefined features.

QCC:
- The group we looked at used css and js folders, but just like bootstrap, with foundation, you can
just insert a link referencing foundation to use it.
- What other features are there unique to Foundation?


Q0:
No

Q1:
We prefer bootstrap to foundation because we find that bootstrap allows for less effort to
create good looking sites (more features) whereas foundation seems to be more DIY. Less
effort on CSS means that we can focus more on the core functionality of the website.
