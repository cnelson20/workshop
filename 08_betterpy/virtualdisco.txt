K08 -- Python Virtual Env. Observations
2021-09-30

From what I read from https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html,
i believe running python3 -m venv ~/whatever creates a virtual environment 
in the supplied directory that can have different packages / python modules 
than the main computer.

From https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/ I learned more about 
the file structure Python creates.
(these are subdirectories)
bin - holds program files for the virtual env.
include - c headers for any packages you might install
lib - holds a copy of python and other dependencies for whatever you are 
using the virtual environment for.
