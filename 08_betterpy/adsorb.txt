K08 - Comparing Python Code

I think most of our scripts were fairly similar. 
I looked at like 8 people's scripts and every person used random.choices() to generate
the weighted result.
Some people did use the csv library to parse the file into a dict, 
but from the workshops I looked at more people just read the file using open()
and read() and then parsing the file in some way. The parsing of the file was the most unique
part of each team's code (reasonably so, you can do it a bunch of ways).
