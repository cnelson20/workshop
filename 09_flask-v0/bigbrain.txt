K09 -- Flask Observations

Q0: This line constructs a Flask object (though IDK what properties it has), which is like java.

Q1: app.route("/") should refer to the base of the linux directory

Q2: This should print the name of the function, "hello_world"

Q3: I don't think this gets printed, though i'm very unsure about it. 
As it turns out it returns this text if you connect to it in a web browser on the given ipv4 and port

Q4: We saw this in java very often where you call a function of an object.
